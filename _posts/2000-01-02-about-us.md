#### Rice Launch


#is a student lead organization that brings together aspiring entrepreneurs from around [Rice University](http://rice.edu) 

to promote awareness, education, and collaboration. In this entrepreneurial community, we provide connections to opportunities at Rice and beyond, mentorship and resources that equip students to bring their ideas to fruition, and a platform for students with common passion to meet and lay the foundation for their future ventures. With these tools, we empower students to create the unconventional solutions to today’s problems that will have a positive impact on tomorrow’s society.
