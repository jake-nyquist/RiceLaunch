Rice Launch hosts a series of events each year designed to educate Rice students about Entrepreneurship. 

**3 Day Startup:** Take a technology hackathon, infuse it with business development, and that’s what the 3DS is about. Start up a company in 3 days. Rather than just talk about startups, or sit on the next billion dollar idea, execute and make it a reality. 

**Entrepreneurship Summit:** The summit is a place where Rice students are introduced to the bold world of startups and provided the starter kit to understand what being an entrepreneur is all about. Come learn what it takes for you to reach the top, and build the networks that can bring you there.

**Owl Open:** The Owl Open is one of Rice’s flagship startup competitions. A university-wide business plan competition, winning teams will receive cash prizes and an opportunity to be a part of the OwlSpark startup accelerator.
